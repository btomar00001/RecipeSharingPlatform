## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- **Apache Tomcat** (for Servlet-based deployment)
- **MySQL** (for database management)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-sharing-platform.git
Configure Database:

Create a MySQL database named recipe_db.
Update the database connection details in the configuration file (e.g., db.properties).
Build the Project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the Application:

For Spring Boot: mvn spring-boot:run
For Servlets: Deploy the WAR file to your Apache Tomcat server.
Access the Application:

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
Usage
Register and Login:

Users need to register with an email and password to access platform features.
Post a Recipe:

Once logged in, users can post their own recipes, including a title, ingredients, instructions, category, and an optional image.
Browse and Search Recipes:

Users can explore recipes by browsing categories or using the search feature.
Interact with Recipes:

Users can leave comments and ratings on other users' recipes to provide feedback.
Admin Functions:

Admin users can manage user accounts and moderate recipe content through a dedicated admin interface.
Database Schema
The database schema includes the following tables:

Users: Stores user information (username, email, password, role).
Recipes: Stores details for each recipe (title, description, ingredients, instructions, category, image URL).
Comments: Stores comments on recipes (user, recipe ID, comment text, timestamp).
Ratings: Stores ratings for recipes (user, recipe ID, rating score).
